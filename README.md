# Home-Automation
It uses an Arduino(or even Node MCU) and an ESP8266 WiFi Module to control any Electronic Appliance with Google Assistant<br>
We have to create an IFTTT applet which will connect our Google Assistant to our ThingSpeak cloud.<br>
The ThingSpeak cloud inturns sends our response to the WiFi module of our setup and according to our instruction, it either switches ON or OFF the Electrical Appliance.<br>
We can connect our Arduino to our appliance through a Relay Module<br>
Components Required:
1)	Arduino Uno with cable<br>
2)	Esp8266(Wi-Fi module)<br>
3)	5v Relay two channel<br>
4)	230v bulb along with holder<br>
5)	Wires<br>
6)	Jumper cables<br>
